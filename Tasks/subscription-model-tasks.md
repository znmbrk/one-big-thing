- [ ] Display task completion indicators on the calendar days.
- [ ] When a user taps on a day, show task details in a modal or an expanded view.
- [ ] Replace the "Timeline" view with the new "Calendar" view for premium users on the `HistoryScreen`.
- [ ] Ensure the calendar is performant and handles years of data gracefully.
- [ ] Add elegant animations for month transitions and day selections.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Implement data export and analytics (future phase)
