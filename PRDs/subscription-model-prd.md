# Product Requirements Document: Subscription Model for Lifetime History Access

## Introduction/Overview

The "One Big Thing" app currently allows users to track their daily "one big thing" tasks with a beautiful, animated interface. However, free users are limited to viewing only the current calendar week, while premium users will have unlimited access to their entire lifetime of completed tasks. This subscription model enables users to see their full growth journey over time, providing valuable insights into their long-term progress and personal development.

**Problem**: Free users cannot access their historical data beyond the current week, limiting their ability to track long-term progress and see patterns in their personal growth journey.

**Goal**: Implement an elegant subscription model that provides premium users with unlimited access to their lifetime history while maintaining the app's beautiful, smooth UI experience.

## Goals

1. **Increase User Engagement**: Provide premium users with unlimited historical data access to encourage long-term app usage
2. **Monetization**: Generate revenue through premium subscriptions while maintaining a generous free tier
3. **User Retention**: Create value through lifetime data access that encourages users to maintain their daily habit
4. **Seamless UX**: Implement premium features without disrupting the existing elegant UI patterns
5. **Data Preservation**: Ensure user data is safely preserved and accessible across subscription changes

## User Stories

### Free Users
- **As a free user**, I want to see my current week's tasks so I can stay focused on the present and maintain my daily habit
- **As a free user**, I want to understand the value of premium so I can make an informed decision about upgrading
- **As a free user**, I want to see a preview of what premium offers so I can evaluate the upgrade value

### Premium Users
- **As a premium user**, I want to see my entire lifetime of "one big things" so I can track my long-term growth and progress
- **As a premium user**, I want to scroll through unlimited historical data so I can reminisce about past achievements
- **As a premium user**, I want to maintain access to my data even if I downgrade so I don't lose my personal history
- **As a premium user**, I want the same beautiful UI experience as free users so the upgrade feels seamless

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Free Tier Limitations
- The system must limit free users to viewing only the current calendar week (7 days)
- The system must display a clear indication when users reach the free tier limit
- The system must provide an elegant upgrade prompt when users attempt to access historical data beyond the current week

### 2. Premium Tier Features
- The system must provide premium users with unlimited access to all historical task data
- The system must maintain the existing beautiful grid and timeline view modes for premium users
- The system must preserve all user data regardless of subscription status

### 3. Upgrade Flow
- The system must display an elegant upgrade modal when free users attempt to access premium features
- The system must provide clear value proposition messaging about lifetime history access
- The system must integrate with the existing subscription management system

### 4. UI/UX Requirements
- The system must maintain the existing animated grid layout and smooth transitions
- The system must use consistent theming with the existing design system
- The system must provide visual indicators for premium features without being intrusive
- The system must implement smooth loading states for large historical datasets

### 5. Data Management
- The system must efficiently load and display large amounts of historical data
- The system must implement pagination or virtualization for optimal performance
- The system must preserve user data when subscription status changes

### 6. Subscription Management
- The system must detect and respond to subscription status changes in real-time
- The system must gracefully handle subscription expiration and renewal
- The system must provide clear feedback about current subscription status

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Free trial period implementation
- Multiple pricing tiers beyond free vs premium
- Data export functionality
- Advanced analytics or insights features
- Social sharing of historical data
- Offline access to unlimited historical data
- Custom themes or advanced personalization for premium users

## Design Considerations

### Premium Indicators
- **Subtle Badge**: Add a small, elegant premium badge to the HistoryScreen header when user has premium access
- **Unlimited Scroll**: Remove any artificial limits on timeline scrolling for premium users

### Upgrade Flow Design

- **Value Proposition**: Clear, benefit-focused messaging about lifetime access
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Maintain the existing card-based design with premium features clearly highlighted

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement efficient data loading for large historical datasets
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed historical data to improve performance
- **Smooth Transitions**: Ensure seamless transitions between free and premium states

## Technical Considerations

### Data Architecture
- Implement efficient database queries for large historical datasets
- Use pagination or infinite scroll for timeline view
- Consider data compression for long-term storage

### Subscription Integration
- Integrate with existing subscription management system
- Implement real-time subscription status checking
- Handle edge cases for subscription changes

### Performance Optimization
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Use React Native's FlatList optimization features
- Consider implementing data prefetching for better UX

### State Management
- Extend existing context/hooks to handle subscription status
- Implement proper state updates when subscription changes
- Maintain data consistency across subscription states

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of free users who upgrade to premium
- **Revenue**: Monthly recurring revenue from premium subscriptions
- **User Retention**: Improved retention rates for premium users vs free users

### Secondary Metrics
- **Feature Adoption**: Percentage of premium users who actively use historical data
- **User Engagement**: Increased time spent in the app by premium users
- **Support Tickets**: Reduction in support requests related to data access limitations

### Qualitative Metrics
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback about lifetime history access
- **Feature Usage**: High engagement with historical data features
- **Upgrade Satisfaction**: Low churn rate after premium upgrade

## Open Questions

1. **Pricing Strategy**: What should be the optimal price point for the premium subscription?
2. **Data Retention**: How long should we retain user data for premium users who downgrade?
3. **Performance Limits**: What is the maximum amount of historical data we should support?
4. **Offline Access**: Should premium users have offline access to their historical data?
5. **Data Migration**: How should we handle existing users when the subscription model launches?
6. **A/B Testing**: Should we test different upgrade prompts or pricing strategies?
7. **Analytics**: What specific user behavior data should we track for premium features?
8. **Internationalization**: How should we handle pricing and messaging for different regions?
