# PRD: History Screen Redesign

## Introduction/Overview
Transform the History screen into an elegant, insightful view of task completion patterns while maintaining app simplicity. Focus on clear visualization and meaningful insights. The current implementation shows a basic list that doesn't provide clear patterns or engagement with past achievements.

## Goals
1. Show completion patterns clearly
2. Make past achievements more engaging
3. Keep the UI clean and intuitive
4. Surface basic insights naturally
5. Increase user engagement with history

## User Stories
1. "As a user, I want to quickly see how I did this week"
2. "As a user, I want to feel good about my completed tasks"
3. "As a user, I want to understand my basic patterns"
4. "As a user, I want to easily track my weekly progress"
5. "As a user, I want to see my current streak at a glance"

## Functional Requirements
1. Weekly Snapshot
   - Simple 7-day visual grid
   - Clear completion indicators
   - Current streak display
   - Smooth animations
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality

2. Task Timeline
   - Clean, card-based layout
   - Completion status with visual indicators
   - Task description
   - Date grouping
   - Smooth scrolling experience

3. Basic Insights
   - Weekly completion rate
   - Current streak counter
   - Best streak display
   - Simple completion patterns
   - Achievement highlights

## Non-Goals
1. Complex analytics
2. Social features
3. Task editing
4. Timezone handling
5. Categories/tags
6. Detailed statistics
7. Calendar integration

## Design Considerations
- Minimalist, modern look
- Smooth animations for state changes
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Thoughtful spacing and layout
- Consistent with app's design language
- Accessible color choices
- Intuitive gesture support

## Technical Considerations
- Use existing task storage system
- Simple caching for performance
- Basic pull-to-refresh mechanism
- Maintain offline support
- Efficient list rendering
- State management for animations
- Error handling for data loading

## Success Metrics
1. Quantitative
   - Users check history more often
   - Users complete more tasks
   - Increased session duration
   - Higher weekly completion rates

2. Qualitative
   - Positive feedback on design
   - User satisfaction with insights
   - Improved motivation reported
   - Feature discoverability

## Open Questions
1. How many days of history to show initially?
2. Should we add a simple share feature later?
3. What's the optimal balance of insights vs simplicity?
4. How should we handle empty states?
5. What animation timings feel most natural?
